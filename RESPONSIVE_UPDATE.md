# 📱 Responsive Design Update

I have overhauled the entire frontend to be fully responsive on Mobile (Phone) and Tablet screens! 🚀

## Key Changes:
1.  **Mobile Navigation**: 
    - Added a **Hamburger Menu** on mobile.
    - Sidebar now slides in/out smoothly.
    - Main content expands to full width on mobile.

2.  **Dashboard**:
    - **Stats Grid**: Adapts from 1 column (phone) to 4 columns (desktop).
    - **Charts**: Stack vertically on mobile for better readability.
    - **Search Bar**: Optimized padding so text doesn't hide behind the button.

3.  **Jobs Page**:
    - **Header**: Title and Export buttons stack neatly on mobile.
    - **Filters**: Inputs wrap to new lines on small screens.

4.  **Trends & Regional Pages**:
    - **Tabs**: Category buttons wrap instead of overflowing.
    - **Layouts**: Charts and tables adapt to screen width (using horizontal scroll where needed).

## 🚀 Deploy the Update

To see these changes live, push the code to Render:

```bash

```

Enjoy your mobile-friendly Dashboard! 📱✨
